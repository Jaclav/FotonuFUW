We begin by considering distinguishability in the polarization degree of freedom. We then consider spectral distinguishability, and show explicitly how to calculate the {HOM} dip for three interesting cases: 1) photons with arbitrary spectral distributions, 2) spectrally entangled photons, and 3) spectrally mixed photons.},

	abstract = {Two major requirements in the construction of the Hong–Ou–Mandel interferometer are the alignment and length balancing of two optical paths. A new method is presented for meeting these requirements that requires no custom optics or expensive equipment. Using this method, a two photon interferometer sourced by degenerate noncollinear parametric photon pairs was aligned and the optical paths were balanced to within an average of 11.6 μm, yielding two-photon interference features with visibilities of ∼0.9. The method is applicable to arbitrary noncollinear emission angles, including nondegenerate downconversion situations where the signal and idler emission angles differ.},

	abstract = {We use polarization-entangled photon pairs to demonstrate quantum nonlocality in an experiment suitable for advanced undergraduates. The photons are produced by spontaneous parametric downconversion using a violet diode laser and two nonlinear crystals. The polarization state of the photons is tunable. Using an entangled state analogous to that described in the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox, we demonstrate strong polarization correlations of the entangled photons. Bell’s idea of a hidden variable theory is presented by way of an example and compared to the quantum prediction. A test of the Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt version of the Bell inequality finds S=2.307±0.035, in clear contradiction of hidden variable theories. The experiments described can be performed in an afternoon.},
